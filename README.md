A speech recognition system converts spoken language into text. It typically involves:

1. Audio Input: Capturing spoken words through a microphone.
2. Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the audio signal for analysis.
3. Feature Extraction: Identifying relevant characteristics from the audio signal.
4. Recognition: Using algorithms and models (like neural networks) to match these features to known words or phrases.
5. Post-processing: Refining and formatting the recognized text for output.

The system enables applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and hands-free controls.
